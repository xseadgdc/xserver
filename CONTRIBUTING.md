# Contribution Guidelines

1. All commits need a sign-off by the author (except for drafts)
   If additional reviewers gave their ack, a proper attribution
   header may be added.

2. Commit messages should explain what's really done here and their
   headlines need a short an precise subject. See history for examples.

   Keep in mind that history is also a piece of documentation.

3. Once release is out, bugfixes should be submitted separately, against
   the affected release branch(es) as well as master (so multiple MRs)

4. If new functions or types are introduced, these should be documented
   in-code, so we can generate docs directly from the code :)

5. Use MR tags if you can - if we need some more, just ask.
